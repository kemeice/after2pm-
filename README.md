# after2pm-
The script will look at the time of day and  you can program your custom action . 
This is mostly used with eccomerce for example you want al orders placed after x hours to be considered for the next day .
The script also process all orders placed on saturdays and sundays as monday .

you can change the hour in the script to after 5 pm or ect .
you can also change the case as what to do after the hour so I just said 
$nextday=3;
$twodays=4;
however I have process functions and call clasees in these cases 
hope it helps!
