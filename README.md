# after2pm-
The script will look at the time of day and take action . 
This is mostly used with ecomerce for example you want all orders placed after x hours to be considered for the next day .
The script also process all orders placed on saturdays and sundays as monday .

you can change the hour in the script to after 5 pm or ect .
you can also change the case as what to do after hours.
hope it helps!
